# env_vars.yaml - Frontend Production Environment Variables
# This file is used by Cloud Run for production deployments

# API Backend URL (automatically set during build)
# The React app hardcodes this at build time, so this is primarily for documentation
# See frontend/src/api.js for the actual configuration

# CORS and security headers are handled by nginx.conf
# React environment variables must be set at BUILD TIME, not runtime
# For runtime configuration, we'd need to inject via a config endpoint

# Note: React apps bake environment variables into the bundle at build time
# If you need runtime configuration, consider using a /config endpoint from backend
